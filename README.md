## Project Overview

### About FilmSeeker

FilmSeeker is actually my own fictional startup idea during my second year of college. It's a web application where users can search for movies, add them to a watchlist, add ratings to the movies, etc. Because I hadn't learned web development back then, so that idea only remained as an idea. Fortunately, now I have the opportunity to really develop it into a real web application.
The logo was made by myself using Adobe Illustrator.
